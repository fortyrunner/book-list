# Interesting and recommended books

_Below is a highly opinionated list of books that should be useful to any software developer. There is a distinctly Java slant to this list because that is the language that I know best and still prefer to develop in._

_As well as a main language such as Java, C, Go or C#, you should have a good knowledge of a scripting language such as Python or Powershell. Depending on your preference for OS, a good knowledge of the shell is essential. Now that Windows 10 has the Linux sub-system built, it is possible to use bash across the 3 main operating systems. 
Being able to use grep, cut, sort, sed, and awk has helped me every single day for the past 20 years._

# Some obvious choices

Whilst it may seem a bit pointless to include some very obvious choices, I've done it anyway. The below should be on every Java developers bookshelf.

* [Effective Java - Joshua Bloch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_26?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=effective+java+3rd+edition&sprefix=effective+java+3rd+edition%2Caps%2C127&crid=2NRK2LLWA1T7Z)
   
   _This is the standard by which all other Java books are measured. I've owned all 3 Editions and refer to them all the time._
* [Java Concurrency in Practice - Brian Goetz](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=X5Z0WH8KDBP6VG5W5T2X)

   A true classic. Doesn't include anything from Java 7 onwards but still the best book on Java Concurrency.   
* [Refactoring - Martin Fowler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672/ref=pd_sim_14_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=XN1A5912TVNNCRWY37MK)

   Everything in this book seems obvious, that's why Martin Fowler is such a great author, the book makes you feel smarter as you read it.
   [UPDATE - Mar 2018] A [second edition](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201803-refactoring-2nd-ed.html) is in the works using JavaScript as the core language.

# Best Practices

* [Clean Code - Bob Martin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1520752628&sr=8-3&keywords=effective+java+3rd+edition&dpID=51bPR2V9fBL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

   A bible of best practice for new and experienced developers alike.
* [Code Complete - Steve McConnell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=C8G2D3RHKE0VH5DKWKBP)

   Possibly showing its age now, but still a very good and very relevant read. This book was the first of its kind, a book that talked about best practice outside academia and I devoured it when it came out.
* [Enterprise Integration patterns - Gregor Hohpe](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321200683/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520753396&sr=1-3&keywords=gregor+hohpe&dpID=51eqtvacK7L&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

   When you read this book, the Martin Fowler Refactoring and the Uncle Bob books, you will think 'Oh, that's obvious, we have been doing that for years!' They seem obvious because someone took huge efforts, time and trouble to categorise, classify and debug the techniques. The value of the book is that pretty much everything you need to know about ETL is documented in this book and given a name. It is a very important book and the basis for many tools such as Camel, Spring Integration, Storm etc. 
* [Release It - Michael Nygard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520753584&sr=1-1&keywords=release+it&dpID=41zOc0WXjzL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

  How to productionise your code. Superb book (I must get the latest edition). Ship It is just as good.
* [The Phoenix project - Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/ref=pd_sim_14_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=K7NY9T0WAY09TP1TPW6K)

  This is a novelised form of a project that goes wrong and how it is corrected. It's a wonderfully easy read and at no time will you feel as if you are being preached to.

* [The Art of Agile Development - James Shore](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675)

   I've found this to be the best single reference on Agile (with a big A) and agile with a small a. A nice reference that you can pick up, open any page and find something useful.
* [Make Your Bed - William H McRaven](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Bed-things-change-ebook/dp/B0714M8P9Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520754828&sr=1-1&keywords=make+your+bed)

   _Setting good habits saves you time and reduces stress._
   
# Databases
* [SQL for Smarties - Joe Celko](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joe-Celkos-SQL-Smarties-Programming/dp/0128007613/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520753436&sr=1-1&keywords=sql+for+smarties&dpID=418DAlD7WPL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

   I have a really old copy of this book that is still relevant.

* [SQL CookBook - Anthony Molinaro](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Anthony-Molinaro/dp/0596009763/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520753467&sr=1-1&keywords=sql+cookbook&dpID=516Q77SFBAL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)
* [SQL Anti Patterns - Bill Karwin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SQL-Antipatterns-Programming-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356557/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520753520&sr=1-1&keywords=sql+antipatterns&dpID=41w1oa0YarL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

  Most pattern books show you how to do the right thing, that's great but it is sometimes more useful to look at bad practices so you know what to avoid. I'd add the original [Anti-Patterns](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Software-Architecture-Projects/dp/0471197130) book in there as well. 
  [NOTE] The reviews of Anti-Patterns contain some of the most polarized opinions I have ever read.

# Tools and techniques

_Choosing the right tool can save you days or months of work._

* [Apache Camel in Action - Claus Ibsen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Camel-Action-Second-Claus-Ibsen/dp/1617292931/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520754532&sr=1-1&keywords=camel+in+action&dpID=51XIT-UyRIL&preST=_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch)

   _Apache Camel is one of those tools that saves you time on routine Enterprise developments. Want to watch a directory for a file, filter it, insert into a database and send the results to a JMX queue? 
   Camel can do that in a few lines of easy to read code._
* [Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook - Scott Cranton](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Developers-Cookbook-Integration-Accessible-Recipes/dp/1782170308/ref=pd_sim_14_5?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=Q21FR1783E6X3XCEXF2J)
* [Analyzing Business Data with Excel - Gerald Knight](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Analyzing-Business-Excel-Gerald-Knight/dp/0596100736/ref=sr_1_sc_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1520754698&sr=1-2-spell&keywords=analyzing+bysiness+data+with+excel)

   _Excel is a wonderful tool for analysing data. OK, you can do the same thing in Python or SQL, but Excel is so easy to use and so easy to distribute to other people._

# Recent Reads

* [Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=pd_sim_14_23?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=NG9DXTGWXNKB31RVQDBP)

  I saw Martin Kleppman talk at QCon London and really enjoyed his talk. I bought his book and (as of March 2018) am still working through it.

  I have to confess that I don't find this an easy read. It seems a bit too verbose and the kindle version has a slightly odd format. The core content is very good though and I may buy the paper book, that may be easier to read.

* [Production Ready Microservices - Susan Fowler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Production-Ready-Microservices-Standardized-Engineering-Organization/dp/1491965975/ref=pd_sim_14_6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VTHJJC4K8FFKE2XP2G6Y)

   I love the No Starch Press titles. They are fun, well written and clear. Difficult to put down when you start reading.
