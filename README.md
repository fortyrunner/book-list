# Interesting and recommended books

_Below is a highly opinionated list of books that should be useful to any software developer, there is a distinctly Java slant because that is the language that I know best and still prefer to develop in._

_As well as a main language such as Java, C, Go or C#, you should have a good knowledge of a scripting language such as Python or Powershell. You should also have a good knowledge of command line utilities such as bash. Being able to use grep, cut, sort, sed, and awk has helped me every single day for the past 20 years._

## Some obvious choices
